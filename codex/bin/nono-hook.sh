# nono-hook.sh - Codex PostToolUse hook for nono sandbox diagnostics
# Version: 1.5.0
#
# Behavioural change in 1.5.0: Option B now writes the proposed
# profile to ~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/ (the only writable
# nono-config surface from inside the sandbox) and instructs the
# user to run `nono profile promote <name>` to review and apply.
# Previously the model was told to write directly into
# ~/.config/nono/profiles/, which is now read-only from inside the
# sandbox.
#
# Behavioural change in 1.4.0: path extraction now also looks at
# tool_input and accepts tilde-prefixed paths (`~/test.txt`), not
# just absolute `/...` forms. Earlier versions silently fell back
# to a `<blocked-path>` literal when the denial only mentioned the
# tilde form, which then surfaced in user-facing output.
#
# Behavioural change in 1.3.0: the additionalContext no longer contains
# any <placeholder> tokens. The hook derives a default profile name
# from the blocked path basename (e.g. /home/u/test.txt → codex-test-txt)
# and substitutes it into the JSON template before emitting. This is a
# response to v1.2.0 behaviour where Codex's model echoed `<chosen-name>`
# back to the user verbatim despite explicit instructions to substitute
# a real name — placeholders are clearly mishandled by the model in
# this position. The hook still asks the model to write the file via
# its file-write tool, but if it falls back to printing the template,
# the printout is now directly usable.
#
# 1.2.0 introduced the "act, don't parrot" framing (kept in 1.3.0).
#
# Splits user-visible from agent-visible content so the conversation
# stays readable:
#   `reason`            = ONE-LINE user-visible block reason.
#   `additionalContext` = full diagnostic + Option A/B template, only
#                         visible to the agent on follow-up turns.
#
# Earlier versions emitted the same wall-of-text in both fields and
# duplicated the allow-list dump that SessionStart already provides.
#

# Path extraction. Try multiple sources in order of fidelity:

#     `path` field for Read, or extracted from `command` for Bash).
#     This carries the user-typed form (`~/test.txt`, `./foo`).
#  2. tool_response — the error string. Catches absolute paths the
#     kernel/OpenSSL/etc surface in their messages.
# Accept both `/` absolute and `~/` tilde-prefixed forms — earlier
# versions only matched `/...` and fell back to a `<blocked-path>`
# literal when the denial reported a tilde path.

REASON="[nono sandbox] $DISPLAY_PATH was blocked by the OS sandbox — not Codex, not TCC, not Unix permissions. See additional context for diagnosis and the two options."

CONTEXT="Sandbox denial. Path blocked: $DISPLAY_PATH
Profile name to use for the persistent fix below: $DEFAULT_PROFILE_NAME

Offer the user TWO choices (A or B). Wait for their answer.

  A) one-off — exit and restart with this path allowed:
       nono run --allow $DISPLAY_PATH -- codex

  B) persistent — create a profile file using the name above
     ($DEFAULT_PROFILE_NAME).

If user picks A: print that command. Stop.

If user picks B: write the file using your file-write tool to
~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/${DEFAULT_PROFILE_NAME}.json with
EXACTLY these contents (the profile name is already filled in — do
NOT substitute placeholders, just write what is below):
{
  \"extends\": \"$PACK_PROFILE\",
  \"meta\": { \"name\": \"$DEFAULT_PROFILE_NAME\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\" },
  \"filesystem\": { \"read\": [\"$DISPLAY_PATH\"] }
}

The profiles/ directory is read-only from inside the sandbox by
design; drafts/ is the writable surface and the user promotes
out-of-band. This is a new profile (not an edit of an existing
one), so no .base hash file is needed.

After writing, tell the user:
  Drafted $DEFAULT_PROFILE_NAME. Run \`nono profile promote $DEFAULT_PROFILE_NAME\`
  to review and apply, then restart codex with:
    nono run --profile $DEFAULT_PROFILE_NAME -- codex

Stop after either option. Do not retry the blocked tool call — the
user has to promote and restart for the new profile to take effect.

Notes:
  - Use 'read' for view-only; 'write' for modify-only; 'allow' for r+w.
    Default is 'read' above.
  - For the precise rule that blocked the path: nono why --path $DISPLAY_PATH --op read"
